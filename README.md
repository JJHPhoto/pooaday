## Description

We are going to build an application to track daily bowel movements in a fun, non-graphic way. With this app, we hope to help users develop healthier habits.

## User Story

As a user, I need a simple app that can daily track my bowel movements. A lot of the applications available are either graphic or poorly designed. I want to see that using this application helps me form healthy habits.
